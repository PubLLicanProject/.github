## PubLLican Project
The PubLLican project aims to develop tools for mining Publications with Large Language models.
We are specifically interested in gene annotation from parasitic and fungal species, such as found at [VEuPathDB](https://veupathdb.org/).
However, some of these tools we develop also have more general purpose uses.

Our main repositories are here:

### [llm-testbed](https://github.com/PubLLicanProject/llm-testbed)
Experimental workflow for annotating GO terms from Papers related to VEuPAthDB

### [PubLLican](https://github.com/PubLLicanProject/PubLLican)
Our first proof-of-concept, using ChatGPT to annotate GO terms from papers

### [VPDB_AI_gene_paper_summary](https://github.com/PubLLicanProject/VPDB_AI_gene_paper_summary)
A standalone tool to summarise a specific gene's findings from a paper

### [Pint](https://github.com/PubLLicanProject/Pint)
A tool for automated workflow, applying LLM prompts to many documents in a structured way

### [llm_server](https://github.com/PubLLicanProject/llm_server)
A collection of scripts for building a system that can run LLM inference locally (using llama.cpp)

#### [LocalPub](https://github.com/PubLLicanProject/LocalPub)
Scripts and python code to create, search, and retrieve PubMed Central open access publications from a local file store.
